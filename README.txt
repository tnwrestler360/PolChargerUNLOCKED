There are two versions of the charger.
The version included in the stream folder is setup that only stock wheels will work with the standard body. Any other wheel will require the widebody.
The version included in OPTIONS is designed to be used with a script like VStancer. 

If you want to replace with the VStancer version, drag the files from OPTIONS and just replace them in the stream folder.

If you do not want to replace with the VStancer version, make sure to delete the two files!
